description: "This course will dig deeper into some of the core functionality of Google Sheets. There's a whole bunch of predefined functions we'll cover, like `SUM()` and `AVERAGE()`, and `VLOOKUP()`. We'll apply these techniques to do some analysis on your grades in school, look at performance statistics within a company, track monthly sales, and look at some real geographical information about the countries of the world."
